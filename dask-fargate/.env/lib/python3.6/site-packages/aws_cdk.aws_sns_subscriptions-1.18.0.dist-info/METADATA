This library provides constructs for adding subscriptions to an Amazon SNS topic.
Subscriptions can be added by calling the `.addSubscription(...)` method on the topic.

## Subscriptions

Subscriptions can be added to the following endpoints:

* HTTPS
* Amazon SQS
* AWS Lambda
* Email

Create an Amazon SNS Topic to add subscriptions.

```python
# Example automatically generated. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
import aws_cdk.aws_sns as sns

my_topic = sns.Topic(self, "MyTopic")
```

### HTTPS

Add an HTTPS Subscription to your topic:

```python
# Example automatically generated. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
import aws_cdk.aws_sns_subscriptions as subscriptions

my_topic.add_subscription(subsscriptions.UrlSubscription("https://foobar.com/"))
```

### Amazon SQS

Subscribe a queue to your topic:

```python
# Example automatically generated. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
import aws_cdk.aws_sqs as sqs
import aws_cdk.aws_sns_subscriptions as subscriptions

my_queue = sqs.Queue(self, "MyQueue")

my_topic.add_subscription(subsscriptions.SqsSubscription(queue))
```

Note that subscriptions of queues in different accounts need to be manually confirmed by
reading the initial message from the queue and visiting the link found in it.

### AWS Lambda

Subscribe an AWS Lambda function to your topic:

```python
# Example automatically generated. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
import aws_cdk.aws_lambda as lambda
import aws_cdk.aws_sns_subscriptions as subscriptions

my_function = lambda.Function(self, "Echo",
    handler="index.handler",
    runtime=lambda.Runtime.NODEJS_10_X,
    code=lambda.Code.from_inline(f"exports.handler = {handler.toString()}")
)

my_topic.add_subscription(subscriptions.LambdaSubscription(my_function))
```

### Email

Subscribe an email address to your topic:

```python
# Example automatically generated. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
import aws_cdk.aws_sns_subscriptions as subscriptions

my_topic.add_subscription(subscriptions.EmailSubscription("foo@bar.com"))
```

Note that email subscriptions require confirmation by visiting the link sent to the
email address.
